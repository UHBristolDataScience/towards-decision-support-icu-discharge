# towards-decision-support-icu-discharge
Public code from paper: 'Towards a decision support tool for intensive care discharge: machine learning algorithm development using electronic healthcare data from MIMIC-III and Bristol, UK' (http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025925)

These scripts should be downloaded and run in Jupyter notebook in a python environment to produce feature matrices from MIMIC-III. 

A local MySQL build of MIMIC will be required. Some of the configuration for sql connections will need to be changed to suit your setup. 
If using postgres or another build, some minor modifications to the query syntax will be needed. 

Any questions to: chris.mcwilliams@bristol.ac.uk
